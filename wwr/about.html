            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history2"><div><p>Aqua Adventures was founded in 1998 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who discovered an ancient, enchanted river deep in the Pacific Northwest. Legends spoke of the river's magical properties, and the founders, all skilled rafters, felt compelled to share its wonders with the world. With a few charmed rafts and a dream, they began offering guided trips, quickly gaining a reputation for thrilling, otherworldly experiences. Their commitment to safety, exceptional service, and the river's mystical allure drew adventurers from near and far.</p></div>
            <div><img src="images/rafting2.jpg" alt="people on a raft"></div>
            <div><p>As Aqua Adventures grew, they uncovered hidden waterfalls, secret groves, and whispered trails along the enchanted river. They expanded their offerings to include family-friendly float trips and heart-pounding whitewater adventures, each journey promising a touch of magic. Despite their growth, the company remained true to its mission: providing personal, high-quality experiences while safeguarding the river's natural and mystical beauty. Today, Aqua Adventures is more than a rafting company; it's a gateway to a world of enchantment and adventure, beloved by a community of dreamers and explorers.</p></div></div>
